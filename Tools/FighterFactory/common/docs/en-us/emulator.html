        <h1>Emulator</h1>
        <p>The Emulator editor is used to start a new debug session for the current project, in the engine's Emulator. It's another kind of debugger Fighter Factory supports, but instead of being the native engine as a separate process, it runs inside the program, making real-time inspection of in-game variables and testing a lot faster and robust.</p> 
        <p>Debugging allows you to make the engine stop execution at points defined by breakpoints, so you can track bugs easely and faster.</p> 
        <p>Fighter Factory Studio doesn't come with a general purpose Emulator. This function is provided by the engine's module, so the available feature set is subject to change based on each engine implementation.</p> 
        <p>For more info about debugging, see <a href="debug.html">Debug</a>.</p>

        <h2>Workspace</h2>
        <p>The graphic workspace contains a screen clipped-region where sprites are rendered into and collision/hit boxes (Can be enabled/disabled in the <a href="view">View menu</a>).</p>
        <p>The zoom can be changed using the mouse wheel.</p>
        <p>Keyboard keys can be used to send commands to the engine.</p>
