<p>Defines a reversal. If one of P2's Clns1 boxes comes in contact with one of P1's Clsn1 boxes and a ReversalDef is active, then P1 will reverse P2's attack. Use with p1stateno (and optionally p2stateno) for creating reversal attacks.</p>
<p><b>Required parameters:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>reversal.attr</b> = attr_string (string)<br>
	<i>attr_string specifies the list of attack attributes that can be reversed by this ReversalDef. It is a standard hit attribute string. For instance, reversal.attr = SA,NA,SA means stand+air, normal attack, special attack.</li>

	<li><b>pausetime</b> = p1_pausetime, p2_shaketime (int)<br>
	<i>This is the time that each player will pause on the hit. p1_pausetime is the time to freeze P1, measured in game-ticks. p2_pausetime is the time to make P2 shake before recoiling from the hit. Defaults to 0,0 if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>sparkno</b> = action_no (int)<br>
	<i>This is the action number of the spark to display if the hit is successful. To play a spark out of the player's .AIR file, precede the action number with an S. Defaults to the value set in the player variables if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>hitsound</b> = snd_grp, snd_item (int)<br>
	<i>This is the sound to play on hit (from common.snd). The included fight.snd lets you choose from 5,0 (light hit sound) through to 5,4 (painful whack). To play a sound from the player's own SND file, precede the first number with an "S". For example, "hitsound = S1,0". Defaults to the value set in the player variables if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>p1stateno</b> = state_no (int)<br>
	<i>This is the number of the state to set P1 to if the hit is successful. Used mainly for throws.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>p2stateno</b> = state_no (int)<br>
	<i>This is the number of the state to set P2 to if the hit is successful. P2 will get P1's states and animation data. Used mainly for throws.</i><br></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Optional parameters:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>none</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<p>The sparkxy parameter is treated as an offset to P2's hitdef's sparkxy. The MoveHit trigger can be used to detect if P1 successfully reversed P2.</p>
