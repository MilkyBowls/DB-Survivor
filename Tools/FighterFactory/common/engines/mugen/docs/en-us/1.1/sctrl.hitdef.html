<p>Defines a single hit of the player's attack. If the player's Clsn1 box (red) comes in contact with his opponent's Clsn2 box (blue), and the HitDef was define on or before that particular point in time, then the specified effect will be applied. This is one of the more complex, but most commonly-used controllers.</p>
<p>A single HitDef is valid only for a single hit. To make a move hit several times, you must trigger more than one HitDef during the attack.</p>
<p><b>Required parameters:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>attr</b> = hit_attribute (string)<br>
    <i>This is the attribute of the attack. It is used to determine if the attack can hit P2. It has the format: <br>
    <b>attr</b> = arg1, arg2<br>
    Where:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>arg1 is either "S", "C" or "A". Similar to "statetype" for the StateDef, this says whether the attack is a standing, crouching, or aerial attack.</li>
    <li>arg2 is a 2-character string. The first character is either "N" for "normal", "S" for "special", or "H" for "hyper" (or "super", as it is commonly known). The second character must be either "A" for "attack" (a normal hit attack), "T" for "throw", or "P" for projectile.</li>
  	</ul></i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Optional parameters:</b></p>
<ul>
  	<li><b>hitflag</b> = hit_flags (string)<br>
    <i>This determines what type of state P2 must be in for P1 to hit. hit_flags is a string containing a combination of the following characters:<br>
    "H" for "high", "L" for "low" or "A" for air. "M" (mid) is equivalent to saying "HL". "F" is for fall, and if included will allow P1 to juggle falling opponents in the air. "D" is for "lying Down", and if included allows P1 to hit opponents lying down on the ground.<br>
    Two optional characters are "+" and "-". If "+" is added, then the hit only affects people in a gethit state. This may be useful for chain-moves that should not affect opponents who were not hit by the first move in the chain attack. If "-" is added, then the hit only affects players that are NOT in a gethit state. You should use "-" for throws and other moves you do not want P1 to be able to combo into. "+" and "-" are mutually exclusive, ie. cannot be used at the same time.<br>
    If omitted, this defaults to "MAF".</i><br></li>

	<li><b>guardflag</b> = hit_flags (string)<br>
    <i>This determines how P2 may guard the attack. hit_flags is a string containing a combination of the following characters:<br>
    "H" for "high", "L" for "low" or "A" for air. "M" (mid) is equivalent to saying "HL". If omitted, defaults to an empty string, meaning P2 cannot guard the attack.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>affectteam</b> = team_type (string)<br>
	<i>team_type specifies which team's players can be hit by this HitDef. Use B for both teams (all players), E for enemy team (opponents), or F for friendly team (your own team). The default is E.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>animtype</b> = anim_type (string)<br>
	<i>This refers to the type of animation that P2 will go into when hit by the attack. Choose from "light", "medium", "hard", "back", "up", or "diagup". The first three are self-explanatory. "Back" is the animation where P2 is knocked off her feet. "Up" should be used when the character is knocked straight up in the air (for instance, by an uppercut), and "DiagUp" should be used when the character is knocked up and backwards in the air, eventually landing on his head. The default is "Light".</i><br></li>

	<li><b>air.animtype</b> = anim_type (string)<br>
	<i>Similar to the "animtype" parameter, this is the animtype to set P2 to if P2 is in the air, instead of on the ground. Defaults to the same value as the "animtype" parameter if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>fall.animtype</b> = anim_type (string)<br>
	<i>Similar to the "animtype" parameter, this is the animtype to set P2 to if P2 is hit while falling. Defaults to Up if air.animtype is Up, or Back otherwise.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>priority</b> = hit_prior (int), hit_type (string)<br>
	<i>Specifies the priority for this hit. Hits with higher priorities take precedence over hits with lower priorities. Valid values for hit_prior are 1-7. Defaults to 4. hit_type, if specified, gives the priority class of the hit. Valid priority classes are Dodge, Hit, and Miss. The priority class determines the tiebreaking behavior when P1 and P2 hit each other simultaneously with equal priorities. The behavior for P1 vs. P2 is as follows:<br>
	<ul>
    	<li>Hit vs. Hit: both P1 and P2 are hit</li>
    	<li>Hit vs. Miss: Hit hits, Miss misses</li>
    	<li>Hit vs. Dodge: No hits</li>
    	<li>Dodge vs. Dodge: No hits</li>
    	<li>Dodge vs. Miss: No hits</li>
    	<li>Miss vs. Miss: No hits</li>
    </ul>
    In the case of a no-hit tie, the respective HitDefs stay enabled. "Miss" or "Dodge" are typically used for throws, where P1 and P2 should not be able to simultaneously hit each other. The default for hit_type is "Hit".</i><br></li>

	<li><b>damage</b> = hit_damage, guard_damage (int)<br>
	<i>hit_damage is the damage that P2 takes when hit by P2. The optional guard_damage parameter is the damage taken by P2 if the hit is guarded. Both default to zero if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<i>This is the time that each player will pause on the hit. p1_pausetime is the time to freeze P1, measured in game-ticks. p2_pausetime is the time to make P2 shake before recoiling from the hit. Defaults to 0,0 if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>guard.pausetime</b> = p1_pausetime, p2_shaketime (int)<br>
	<i>Similar to the "pausetime" parameter, these are the times to pause each player if the hit was guarded. Defaults to the same values as the "pausetime" parameter if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>sparkno</b> = action_no (int)<br>
	<i>This is the action number of the spark to display if the hit is successful. To play a spark out of the player's .AIR file, precede the action number with an S, e.g. "sparkno = S10". Defaults to the value set in the player variables if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>guard.sparkno</b> = action_no (int)<br>
	<i>This is the action number of the spark to display if the hit was guarded. To play a spark out of the player's .AIR file, precede the action number with an S. Defaults to the value set in the player variables if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>sparkxy</b> = spark_x, spark_y (int)<br>
 	<i>This is where to make the hit/guard spark. spark_x is a coordinate relative to the front of P2. A negative value makes the spark deeper inside P2. "Front" refers to the x- position at P2's axis offset towards P1 by the corresponding width value in the [Size] group in P2's player variables. spark_y is relative to P1. A negative value makes a spark higher up. You can use a tool like AirView to determine this value by positioning the cursor at the "attack spot" and reading off the value of the y-position. Defaults to 0,0 if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>hitsound</b> = snd_grp, snd_item (int)<br>
	<i>This is the sound to play on hit (from common.snd). The included fight.snd lets you choose from 5,0 (light hit sound) through to 5,4 (painful whack). To play a sound from the player's own SND file, precede the first number with an "S". For example, "hitsound = S1,0". Defaults to the value set in the player variables if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>guardsound</b> = snd_grp, snd_item (int)<br>
	<i>This is the sound to play on guard (from common.snd). Only 6,0 is available at this time. To play a sound from the player's own SND file, precede the first number with an "S". There is no facility to play a sound from the opponent's SND file. Defaults to the value set in the player variables if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>ground.type</b> = attack_type (string)<br>
	<i>This is the kind of attack if P2 is on the ground. Choose from: - "High": for attacks that make P2's head snap backwards. - "Low": for attacks that hit P2 in the stomach. - "Trip": for low sweep attacks. If you use "Trip" type, the ground.velocity parameter should have a non-zero y-velocity, and the fall parameter should be set to 1. A tripped opponent does not bounce upon falling on the ground. - "None": for attacks that do nothing besides pause P1 and P2 for the duration in the pausetime parameter.<br>
	If P2 is hit from behind, "High" will be displayed as "Low" and vice-versa. P2's animation for "High" and "Low" types will be superseded if the AnimType parameter is "Back". Defaults to "High" if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>air.type</b> = attack_type (string)<br>

	<i>Same as "ground.slidetime", but this is the value if P2 guards the hit. Defaults to same value as "guard.hittime".</i><br></li>

	<li><b>ground.hittime</b> = hit_time (int)<br>
	<i>Time that P2 stays in the hit state after being hit. Adjust this value carefully, to make combos possible. Applicable only to hits that keep P2 on the ground. Defaults to 0 if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<i>Same as "ground.hittime", but this is the value if P2 guards the hit. Defaults to same value as "ground.hittime".</i><br></li>

	<li><b>air.hittime</b> = hit_time (int)<br>
	<i>Time that p2 stays in the hit state after being hit in or into the air, before being able to guard again. This parameter has no effect if the "fall" parameter is set to 1. Defaults to 20 if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>guard.ctrltime</b> = ctrl_time (int)<br>
	<i>This is the time before p2 regains control in the ground guard state. Defaults to the same value as "guard.slidetime" if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>guard.dist</b> = x_dist (int)<br>
	<i>This is the x-distance from P1 in which P2 will go into a guard state if P2 is holding the direction away from P1. Defaults to the value in the player variables if omitted. You normally do not need to use this parameter.</i><br></li>

	<i>Specifies the y acceleration to impart to P2 if the hit connects. Defaults to .35 in 240p, .7 in 480p, 1.4 in 720p.</i><br></li>
 
	<li><b>ground.velocity</b> = x_velocity, y_velocity (float)<br>
	<i>Initial velocity to give P2 after being hit, if P2 is on the ground. If y_velocity is not zero, P2 will be knocked into the air. Both values default to 0 if omitted. You can leave out the y_velocity if you want P2 to remain on the ground.</i><br></li>

	<i>Initial velocity to give P2 if P2 is hit in the air. Defaults to 0,0 if omitted.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>airguard.velocity</b> = x_velocity, y_velocity (float)<br>
	<i>Velocity to give P2 if P2 guards the hit in the air. Defaults to x_velocity * 1.5, y_velocity / 2, where x_velocity and y_velocity are values of the "air.velocity" parameter.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>ground.cornerpush.veloff</b> = x_velocity (float)<br>
	<i>Determines the additional velocity (velocity offset) to impart to the player if he lands a ground hit in the corner. Setting this to a higher value will cause the player to be "pushed back" farther out of the corner. If omitted, default value depends on the attr parameter.

TargetID is not to be confused with PlayerID.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>chainID</b> = id_number (int)<br>
	<i>Main use of this is for chain moves. If P2 was last hit by a move by P1 with this ID, only then can he be hit by the HitDef with this chainID. You can use this in the following parts of a chain move. Note that chain moves are still possible even without the use of the "id" and "chainid" parameters. Valid values are all values >= 1. If omitted, defaults to -1 (chain from any hit).</i><br></li>

	<li><b>nochainID</b> = nochain_1, nochain_2 (int)<br>
	<i>nochainID specifies up to 2 ID numbers of hits which cannot be chained into this hit. If these are -1 (the default), then chaining is not explicitly disabled for any hit ID numbers. nochain_2 can be omitted. Except for -1, the values specified must not coincide with the value for chainID. This parameter has no effect if P2 is hit by a third party between P1's previous HitDef and the current HitDef.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>palfx.time</b> = duration (int)<br>
	<i>If included, this allows for palette effects on P2 if the hit is successful. Time specifies the number of ticks that the palette effects should last. Specify -1 to have the palette effects last indefinitely. Specify 0 to stop any ongoing palette effects.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>palfx.sinadd</b> = ampl_r, ampl_g, ampl_b, period (int)<br>
	<i>Creates an additional sine-wave palette addition effect. Period specifies the period of the sine wave in game ticks, and the amplitude parameters control the amplitude of the sine wave for the respective components. For instance, if t represents the number of ticks elapsed since the activation of the PalFX controller, and pal_r is the red component of the character's original palette, then the red component of the character's palette at time t is (pal_r + add_r + ampl_r*sin(2*pi*t/period))*mul_r/256.</i><br></li>

	<li><b>palfx.invertall</b> = bvalue (bool)<br>

	<li><b>palfx.color</b> = value (int)<br>
	<i>This affects the color level of the palette. If value is 0, the palette will be greyscale. If value is 256, there is no change in palette. Values in between will have an intermediate effect.

	<i>If included, this shakes the screen if the hit is successful, but only when P2 hits the ground. Time specifies the number of ticks to shake the screen for.</i></li>
	<li><b>fall.envshake.freq</b> = shake_speed (float)<br>
	<i>shake_speed is a float between 0 (slow shake) to 180 (fast shake). Defaults to 60.</i><br></li>
	<li><b>fall.envshake.ampl</b> = shake_amplitude (int)<br>
	<i>The larger the amplitude, the farther the screen shakes up and down. A negative amplitude means that the screen will shake down first. Defaults to -4.</i><br></li>
	<li><b>fall.envshake.phase</b> = phase_offset (float)<br>
	<i>Specifies the phase offset for the shaking. The default is 0, unless the frequency multiplier is 90 or greater. In this case, the default phase offset is 90.</i></li>
